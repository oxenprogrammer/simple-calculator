      Mathematics (from Greek: μάθημα, máthēma, 'knowledge, study, learning')
      includes the study of such topics as quantity (number theory),[1]
      structure (algebra),[2] space (geometry),[1] and change
      (analysis).[3][4][5] It has no generally accepted definition.[6][7]
      Mathematicians seek and use patterns[8][9] to formulate new conjectures;
      they resolve the truth or falsity of such by mathematical proof. When
      mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical
      reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature.
      Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from
      counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes
      and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human
      activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required
      to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of
      sustained inquiry. Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics,
      most notably in Euclid's Elements.[10] Since the pioneering work of
      Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), David Hilbert (1862–1943), and others on
      axiomatic systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to
      view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction
      from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions. Mathematics developed at
      a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when mathematical
      innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid
      increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the
      present day.[11] Mathematics is essential in many fields, including
      natural science, engineering, medicine, finance, and the social sciences.
      Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such
      as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians engage in pure mathematics
      (mathematics for its own sake) without having any application in mind, but
      practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often
      discovered later.[12][13]
